      "The dramatic light was chosen at a stage of taking photograph to convey the evident atmosphere of tension and uneasiness. Moreover, the notion of the coming out- of-darkness figure works well for my goal of depicting loneliness, as it emphasizes the absence of other creatures around. Furthermore, implicit light that shines upon the face allows to display the facial expression in detailed manner. The use of space also contributes to the development of the theme of loneliness as it focuses viewer’s attention on the solemn figure in the positive space. The rest of the space is negative and is mainly used to highlight the emptiness of the outer world that represents the reason behind one’s loneliness. The face is placed not in the centre that ‘leaves space’ for the emotion itself. this space symbolises the splashing emotion that fills out the space around. Speaking of contrast that is evidently present in all of the ways of using the formal elements, it conveys the main theme of the artwork: the extreme emotion of serenity that one feels. Rigid and nealry-monotone strokes in the background emphasise the elaborative and chaotic texture of the face. This creates a contrast between the background and foreground, highlighting the isolation of the figure.",

      "as my final decision was to create a collage, it was crucial to add some color to it. even though black and white, from my perspective are the most appropriate and efficient when conveying serenity and anxiety, the composition needed color. eventually, i have chosen blue and red as their contrast adds up to the tension conveyed. i have edited the photos by enhancing contrast and, sometimes, saturation. i have chosen one of three sizes for each of my photo: A3, A4 or A5. The only A3 became the most abstract (from my perspective) and the least heavy photo: black dissolving figure on the white background. the other photo’s sizes were chosen experimentally: i was dragging the template of how everything will look together on the white ‘wall’ in Photoshop and decided on each size when i liked the way all looks together. i have decided to put photos on the wall by ‘following my guts’ more than ever. i strived to create a balance, however not to lose the tension and despair the i have incorporated in photos. i wanted to balance red and blue photos, while also paying attention to the heaviness or lightness of composition in each photo. even though i had a lot of photographs from my school campus and from my portrait experiments, i decided to include some photos that i have taken using my phone camera in my hometown. that way, i was able to add other character in my work (my grandma) and diversify the locations: forest, road, interior. this helped me compose a multi-faceted environment and highlight the broadness of the loneliness.",

      "the shapes that I have used were developed in the process of experimentation. the contrast of sizes helps convey the feeling of tension and anxiety. Moreover, the shapes of trees without leaves embeds the perdition atmosphere, which adds up to the ambience of a deserted place. I have integrated various shapes to compose a balanced landscape. throughout the process, I have carved numerous of these forms before deciding on the key ones. moreover, the repetition of these shapes imply the connection between these three relief printmaking works. tiny human figure that drastically contrasts with the massive shapes of ground conveys the feeling of serenity. experiments with napkins, thinner and wrappings to create a range and textures that would convey the incentive to investigate and explore (just as the forest atmosphere provokes to do). using napkin and thinner has helped me to create a “fading” effect that is explicit on the final work3. this adds up to the atmosphere of deserted and evolving place. lines that also convey the feeling of movement -> dynamic nature of the forest. but quite circular, closed arrangement that conveys the feeling of calmness and safety. moreover, as the shapes used are highly graphic, they facilitate the atmosphere of dynamics and evolving place. the motive of closed space combined with the sufficient amount of white to create the freshness and freedom (as i feel in forest) aligned with the solidness and stability of landscape and basic shapes. the empty wide space above the ground adds up to the feeling of serenity and deserted space. overall, i believe that the effective use of space was developed throughout the experiments that I have conducted. I am happy with the result and hope to continue experimenting with space further in my other projects.",

It provides an unsettling feeling and helps transmit the atmosphere of loneliness. Rigid lines created by the minimalistic interior design and shadows that geometrically fall on the floor and walls help draw attention of the viewer to the solemn human figure. Moreover, these lines create shapes that balance each other and form the perspective. Slightly unrealistic perspective provide the feeling of mystery and uneasiness, which contributes to the overall idea of tension and solemnity. this work showcases numerous types of contrasts: tiny figure of a girl vs massive traits of interior, cold colors inside vs warm light outdoors, rigid lines of the interior vs smooth flow of horizon line.",
